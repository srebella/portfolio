            I have over 10 years of experience as a computer engineer, and have worked
            at startups working as freelancer (Upwork) and currently working at The Cooperative Legal Services as Software Developer. While I'm a proficient full-stack
            developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, architecture,
            and async mechanisms).
        </p>

           I love learning new things.
           While solving real customer problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to hard engineering problems.
           I'm looking for a individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
