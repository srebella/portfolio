           I love learning new things.
           While solving real customer problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to hard engineering problems.
           I'm looking for a individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
